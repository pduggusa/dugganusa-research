## Built With Claude Code (Anthropic)

This research was conducted, documented, and consolidated using **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** - Anthropic's agentic AI CLI running **Claude Opus 4.6** (`claude-opus-4-6`).

The entire research pipeline demonstrates enterprise-grade agentic AI capability:

- **Multi-agent exploration** - 5 parallel agents swept 45+ research artifacts across threat intel, compliance, and methodologies
- **Evidence-backed rigor** - Every claim has receipts. Every pattern has suspended accounts. Every detection rule has measured FPR.
- **Production infrastructure** - Automated daily threat scanning, STIX 2.1 feed generation, Judge Dredd 6D compliance verification
- **Epistemic discipline** - 95% confidence caps, honest failure reporting, democratic sharing philosophy

**To the naysayers:** This is what bleeding-edge agentic AI looks like when applied with discipline. Not vibes - evidence. Not demos - production. Not promises - suspended threat actors.

**Platform:** Claude Code CLI + Claude Opus 4.5
**Methodology:** Human-AI collaboration with autonomous multi-agent research sweeps
**Infrastructure:** Azure Container Apps, Cloudflare, STIX/TAXII feeds
