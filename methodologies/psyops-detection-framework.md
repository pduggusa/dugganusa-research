# PsyOps Detection Skill

**Purpose:** Detect psychological manipulation, scams, and engineered narratives using a 20-point scoring framework

**Philosophy:** "Mind control isn't magic — it's pattern recognition"

**Epistemic Humility:** All scores capped at **95% confidence maximum** (never claim 100%)

## The 20-Point Mind Control Detection System

Originally from NCI Engineered Reality Scoring System, adapted for DugganUSA threat intelligence and blog writing.

### Scoring Rubric

Each indicator scores **1-5 points**:
- **1** = Not present
- **2** = Weakly present
- **3** = Moderately present
- **4** = Strongly present
- **5** = Overwhelmingly present

**Total Score Interpretation:**
- **0-25** → Low likelihood of manipulation (score: 0-25%)
- **26-50** → Moderate likelihood (score: 26-50%)
- **51-75** → Strong likelihood (score: 51-75%)
- **76-100** → Overwhelming manipulation indicators (score: 76-95%) ← **CAPPED at 95%**

**95% Cap Philosophy:** "We guarantee a minimum of 5% bullshit exists in any complex system. Claiming 100% certainty is itself a manipulation tactic."

## The 20 Indicators

### Category 1: Information Manipulation (Indicators 1-5)

#### 1. **Timing Manipulation**
**Question:** Is this message released at a suspiciously convenient time?
**Examples:**
- Story appears exactly when another event needs distraction
- "Leaked" information right before a critical decision
- Pattern of releases coordinated with external events

#### 2. **Emotional Manipulation**
**Question:** Does it try to trigger fear, anger, guilt, or shame?
**Examples:**
- "If you don't act now, something terrible will happen"
- Threat inflation (making minor risks seem catastrophic)
- Guilt-based appeals ("You're a bad person if you don't...")

#### 3. **Uniform Messaging**
**Question:** Do different sources repeat the exact same wording?
**Examples:**
- Dozens of outlets using identical phrases
- Copy-paste messaging across "independent" sources
- Scripted talking points (same metaphors, same structure)

#### 4. **Missing Information**
**Question:** Are key details or context absent?
**Examples:**
- Only one side of an event is shown
- Critical facts omitted
- Lack of attribution (who said this? when? where?)

#### 5. **Simplistic Narrative**
**Question:** Is a complex issue reduced to black-and-white?
**Examples:**
- "Good vs evil" framing
- No acknowledgment of nuance
- Binary choices presented as only options

---

### Category 2: Emotional Manipulation (Indicators 6-10)

#### 6. **Tribal Division**
**Question:** Does it divide people into opposing groups?
**Examples:**
- "People like YOU aren't like THEM"
- Identity-based appeals
- In-group vs out-group framing

#### 7. **Authority Overload**
**Question:** Does it overwhelm with experts or official-sounding claims?
**Examples:**
- "Every expert agrees..." (even if they don't)
- Appeal to unnamed authorities
- Credentialism without substance

#### 8. **Urgency / Call to Action**
**Question:** Does it force fast decisions?
**Examples:**
- Phone scams demanding immediate payment
- "Limited time offer" pressure
- Countdown timers, artificial scarcity

#### 9. **Novelty Obsession**
**Question:** Does it rely on shocking new claims?
**Examples:**
- "This changes everything!"
- "What THEY don't want you to know!"
- Sensationalism over substance

#### 10. **Financial / Power Gain**
**Question:** Who benefits if you believe this?
**Examples:**
- High-pressure sales scripts
- Donations to specific causes
- Political campaign messaging

---

### Category 3: Cognitive Manipulation (Indicators 11-15)

#### 11. **Suppression of Dissent**
**Question:** Are critics shamed or dismissed?
**Examples:**
- "Only an idiot wouldn't believe this"
- Ad hominem attacks on skeptics
- Labeling dissent as morally wrong

#### 12. **No Alternatives Offered**
**Question:** Is there only one "solution" presented?
**Examples:**
- "The ONLY way forward is..."
- False dichotomy (only two options when many exist)
- Single-path decision forcing

#### 13. **Emotional Repetition**
**Question:** Are feelings repeated until accepted?
**Examples:**
- Repeating fear stories daily
- Hammering same emotional beat
- Desensitization through repetition

#### 14. **Cherry-Picked Data**
**Question:** Are facts selected to create a false impression?
**Examples:**
- Showing only data supporting the message
- Ignoring contradictory evidence
- Statistical manipulation (misleading graphs, truncated axes)

#### 15. **Logical Fallacies**
**Question:** Does the argument rely on bad logic?
**Examples:**
- "Everyone is doing it, so it's correct" (bandwagon)
- "You're either with us or against us" (false dilemma)
- Strawman arguments (misrepresenting opposing view)

---

### Category 4: Technical & Advanced Manipulation (Indicators 16-20)

#### 16. **Face-Driven Appeals**
**Question:** Does it rely on emotional imagery of people?
**Examples:**
- Sad faces in charity scams
- Angry faces to trigger outrage
- Faces of children/elderly for emotional manipulation

#### 17. **Manufactured Outrage**
**Question:** Are emotions artificially intensified?
**Examples:**
- Viral rage posts
- Outrage farming for engagement
- Amplification of minor incidents

#### 18. **Framing Manipulation**
**Question:** Is the story shaped to steer the audience?
**Examples:**
- Using specific angles or language to direct opinion
- Selective editing of video/audio
- Leading questions

#### 19. **Rapid Behavior Shifts**
**Question:** Does it push sudden or extreme changes?
**Examples:**
- Quick calls to action, "change everything now"
- Demanding immediate lifestyle changes
- Panic-driven decision making

#### 20. **Historical Parallels**
**Question:** Does it compare to extreme past events?
**Examples:**

## How to Apply in Blog Writing

### Tone Integration

When writing blog posts about threats, scams, or deception:

1. **Score the threat using 20-point system**
   - Include score in blog post metadata
   - Example: `psyopsScore: 78` (strong manipulation detected)

2. **Document specific indicators**
   - Don't just say "this is a scam"
   - Say "this hits 14/20 manipulation indicators: urgency (#8), emotional appeals (#2), missing context (#4)..."

3. **Show your work**
   - Transparent scoring (Democratic Sharing Law)
   - Evidence for each indicator
   - Admit uncertainty (95% cap)

4. **Use Story Density**
   - Specific examples (proper names, timestamps, URLs)
   - First-person witness ("I tested this scam call and scored it 85/100")
   - Emotional honesty ("This made me angry because...")

### Example Blog Structure

```markdown
# Title: Scam Analysis - [Specific Threat Name]

**PsyOps Score:** 82/95 (Strong manipulation detected)

## What We Found

[Specific incident, with witness details]

## 20-Point Analysis

**High-scoring indicators:**
- **Emotional Manipulation (#2):** 5/5 - "Your account will be locked unless..."
- **Urgency (#8):** 5/5 - "You have 15 minutes to respond"
- **Authority Overload (#7):** 4/5 - Claimed to be "IRS Criminal Division"
- **Missing Information (#4):** 4/5 - No callback number, no case reference

[Continue through all 20 points]

**Total Score:** 82/100 → **Capped at 95% confidence**

## Integration with Existing Skills

### Judge Dredd D6 (Democratic Sharing)

**New Sub-Metric: Manipulation Transparency Score**

Measures:
- **Documented scams:** How many manipulation attempts we've published
- **Detection methods:** Sharing 20-point framework publicly (not hoarding)
- **Public warnings:** Blog posts about specific threats
- **Evidence ratio:** Screenshots / claims ratio
- **Update frequency:** How often we refresh threat intelligence

**Philosophy:** Hoarding scam detection is morally indefensible. Publish openly.

### Story Density (120.9 Ratio)

PsyOps detection blog posts should include:
- **Proper names:** Specific scam organizations, threat actors
- **Specific places:** URLs, phone numbers, email addresses
- **Concrete incidents:** "On November 21, 2025, I received this call..."
- **Emotional honesty:** "This pissed me off because..."
- **First-person witness:** Actually testing scams, not theorizing

### Pattern #22 (RTFM)

Stand on giants' shoulders:
- DARPA psychological operations research
- DoD PsyOps field manuals
- Academic literature (Cialdini's influence principles)
- The Why Files episode on PsyOps
- Shawn Ryan's Ironclad X series

**Don't reinvent the wheel.** Use established frameworks, add novel contribution: **democratization** (free detection) + **not being a greedy asshole** (public sharing).

## Why PsyOps Work (and Why Scammers Use Them)

Human brains respond predictably to patterns:
- **Urgency** → bypasses rational thinking
- **Fear** → triggers fight-or-flight (not analysis)
- **Group identity** → tribal instincts override logic
- **Emotion-packed stories** → more memorable than facts
- **Simplified choices** → easier to process
- **Authority cues** → shortcut for trust evaluation

**Criminals exploit these cues because they work.**

**Recognizing these patterns defeats them instantly.**

## How to Protect Your Mind

### 7 Anti-Manipulation Strategies

1. **Slow down your responses**
   - PsyOps rely on speed, not logic
   - Take 24 hours before making decisions

2. **Look for missing information**
   - Ask: "What am I NOT being told?"
   - Research alternate sources

3. **Check for emotional triggers**
   - If you feel urgency → someone is trying to influence you
   - Strong emotion = red flag

4. **Identify who benefits**
   - Follow the money
   - If answer is unclear → suspicious

5. **Pause before sharing anything online**
   - 90% of misinformation spreads from emotional reactions
   - Verify before amplifying

6. **Never act from fear**
   - Fear narrows your reasoning
   - Wait until calm to decide

7. **Ask neutral third parties**
   - Scams dissolve under scrutiny
   - Get outside perspective
